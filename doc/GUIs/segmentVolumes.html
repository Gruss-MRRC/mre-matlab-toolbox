    <p><b>function varargout = segmentVolumes(varargin)</b></p>
    <p> Isolate and calculate volume of structures in MRI images.
 
 Opening files 
 -------------
 Open a NIFTI or DICOM image by clicking &quot;Open&quot;. MRI2MAT returns the image
 data and metadata in Matlab matrix format. Coronal, Axial, and Sagittal
 slices are shown in the XZ, XY, and YZ preview planes, respectively. (If
 not, try preprocessing the images with `dcm2nii` and FSL's `bet` and
 `fast` programs or editing the matrices directly in Matlab.) A 3D preview
 of the brain sliced along the sagittal plane is also shown in a separate
 window, which may be closed without causing problems. Note: If the file
 is 4D, the 'Series' slider changes which volume (3D) is shown. Operations 
 like `Isolate` apply only to the active Series.
 
 Navigation
 ----------
 Left-clicking in any image plane adjusts the other image planes so that
 they are aligned with that coordinate. E.g., clicking (y,z) = (10,20) in
 the sagittal plane shows slice 20 in the axial window and a slice with
 y=10 in the coronal plane. If open file has more than three dimensions,
 for example if the NIFTI file contains a breakdown of CSF, gray matter,
 and white matter as separate volumes, the &quot;Series&quot; slider changes
 th active volume (affects 4D images only).
 
 Isolating Regions by Connectivity
 ---------------------------------
 The volume can be reduced to include only specific regions by by clicking
 &quot;Isolate.&quot; The program segments the selected volume by connectivity,
 finding continous non-zero elements in the matrix and assigning labels to
 each discrete body. The user is shown a view of the axial plane with each
 of these regions color-coded. Clicking a region adds it to the selection.
 Selection continues until the user presses Enter.
 
 How Volume is Calculated
 ------------------------
 Every time the view updates, volume is recalculated. The NIFTI image
 header is read to determine the units (m, cm, mm) and dimensions of the
 voxels. The volume is calculated as the sum of all non-zero voxels in the
 matrix.
 
 Select/Cut
 ----------
 To separate the desired region from other connected bodies, you can
 manually remove pieces of the image. To do so, right-click 4 points which
 define a box. The first 2 points determine the Y and Z extents of the
 cut; the second 2 determine the extents in X. Think of this as describing
 a rectangle in the sagittal plane and then setting its width in the
 coronal or axial planes. The action taken depends on the value of
 &quot;Selection&quot;:
 
   &quot;Cut&quot;    -- Everything inside the box is set to 0
   &quot;Select&quot; -- Everything outside the box is set to 0
 
 Erode/Dilate
 ------------
 The &quot;Erode&quot; and &quot;Dilate&quot; buttons execute the Matlab Image Processing
 Toolbox functions `imerode` and `imdilate`. Erosion can be useful to
 break small connections between regions, but should be used sparingly
 because the effect can be quite destructive. Dilation is the inverse
 operation of erode, but doesn't necessarily 'undo' an erosion.%
 
 Undo
 ----
 Pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot; key clears the last point from the cut
 selection. The &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; button clears the entire active cut selection. Note:
 There isn't a function to reset a cut that has been already made.
 
 3D View
 -------
 The &quot;3D&quot; button pops open a new window containing a 3D isosurface of the
 current volume.
 
 Saving
 ------
 Clicking the &quot;Save&quot; button in the toolbar saves the image matrix in a
 .mat-file along with the image header (metadata) and the volume with
 units. The file has the same name and is saved in the same folder as the
 opened image. The path, filename, and volume are added to the .csv file
 in the &quot;Log&quot; text box at the top of the GUI. A warning dialog appears if
 for some reason either file cannot be saved (i.e., a permissions error).
