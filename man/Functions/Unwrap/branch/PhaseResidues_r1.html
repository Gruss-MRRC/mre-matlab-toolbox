    <p>PhaseResidues_r1 - %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
    <div id="synopsis">
    <p>function residue_charge=PhaseResidues(IM_phase, IM_mask);</p>
    <p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 PhaseResidues.m calculates the phase residues for a given wrapped phase
 image. Note that by convention the positions of the phase residues are 
 marked on the top left corner of the 2 by 2 regions.

 Phase residues with integer multiples of 2*pi are not accounted for, but 
 these rarely occur.
