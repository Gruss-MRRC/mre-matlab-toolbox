<h3>NAME</h3>
    <p>BranchCuts_r1 - %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%</p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
    <div id="synopsis">
    <p>function branch_cuts=BranchCuts(residue_charge, max_box_radius, IM_mask)</p>
    <p>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 BranchCuts.m generates branch cuts based on the phase residues. This is
 done using the Goldstein method, as described in &quot;Two-dimensional phase
 unwrapping: theory, algorithms and software&quot; by Dennis Ghiglia and
 Mark Pritt.
 &quot;residue_charge&quot; is a matrix wherein positive residues are 1 and
 negative residues are 0.
 &quot;max_box_radius&quot; defines the maximum search radius for the balancing of
 residues. If this is too large, areas will be isolated by the branch
 cuts.
 &quot;IM_mask&quot; is a binary matrix. This serves as an artificial border for the
 branch cuts to connect to.

             Corrected a NaN divide by zero problem
             Return immediately, if no residues
             Eliminated code Analyzer warnings about &amp;&amp; vs. &amp;, || vs. |
 2010/09/15  Match with residues of opposite sign.
             Change the order of the loops: Put the radius loop on the outside,
             to let each residue try to find its closest neighbor of opposite
             sign.  This generally finds closer pairs.
             Use residue_charge_masked in place of residue_charge in some places.
             Modified &quot;for n&quot; loop to just use the needed indices.
             When making a branch cut to the edge, go straight, rather than diagonally.
             Eliminated unnecessary sections of code &amp; resulting unused variables.
             Sped-up internal function &quot;branch_cuts&quot;.
             Added some error checks.
